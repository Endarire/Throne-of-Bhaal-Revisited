<H1> ~Throne of Bhaal Revisited~ <H1>
<H2> version beta 4 <H2>

</CENTER>

<P>

Unsatisfied with Throne of Bhaal?  Tired of being forced down a linear story with empty characters?  This mod aims to fix that.

DISCLAIMERS:

This is a work in progress.  Not everything is in place, and even though I have tried to test it, some things may be broken.  Drop me a line at 
wildgirlmods@gmail.com if you have any problems.

<br> <br>
WARNINGS:

<UL>
<LI>This readme is full of spoilers, both for this mod and vanilla ToB.  Don't read the readme in full if you want to keep things a surprise. </LI>

<LI>Start a new game (or use a final save from SoA).  Not only will you get to see all the new content, but your game won't be broken. </LI>

<LI>Many new dialogue responses have stat checks to be successful.  They aren't marked, so think before you speak.</LI>

<LI>If you want to see full romance content, vanilla or mod, be sure to take Yaga Shura down sooner rather than later.</LI>

<LI>Beta versions may or may not play nice with each other.  Just to be sure, uninstall all previous versions before installing this one.</LI>

</UL>

OTHER MODS:

There are several mods that add some really good content to ToB.  These are just a few that I suggest adding in.

<UL>
<LI> <a href=http://www.gibberlings3.net/wheels/>Wheels of Prophecy</a>:  Though I can rarely manage to get its name right, this is a really great mod.  It allows you to kill some of 
   the Five in any order, and its Grove of the Ancients scene is much better than mine. </LI>

<LI> <a href=http://www.pocketplane.net/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=128&Itemid=100>SimDing0's Improved Oasis</a>:  He gives you a chance to talk your way out of a fight in the oasis.  I love it when you can
   talk your way out of a fight.</LI>
</UL>

CONTENT:

This mod comes in four major sections:  characters, linearity, places, and quests.  Each section is independent, as is each component inside a section.  
<br>
This is what I have so far:
<br> <br>
Characters:
<UL>
<LI> Gromnir:  You are now given half a chance to reason with him,
           but it may be difficult to talk him down entirely. <br>
	   (Compatible with Ascension's "Tougher Gromnir.") </LI>
	   
<LI> Melissan:  Now she has a magic amulet that protects her from 
	   detect alignment spells. </LI>

<LI> Solar & Sarevok:  Now the Solar opens the first challenge for
	   you.  Why Sarevok should have control of *your* pocket plane I
	   don't know. </LI>
<LI> Yaga Shura:  If he sees an advantage to it, Yaga Shura will ask you to
	   kill Gromnir and, when that doesn't break the siege, Captain Samand. <br>
	   (Compatible with Ascension's "Tougher Yaga Shura.") </LI>

</UL>

<br> 
Linearity:
<UL>
 <LI> Grove of the Ancients:  Instead of being randomly teleported,
           you are led by Ellesime and may have to use your own feet for
           a change. <br>
	   (Compatible with the Longer Road, Wheels of Prophecy, and
	    Ascension's "Tougher Illasera.") </LI>

<LI> Pocket Plane:  With this component it can only take you places you've
	   already been.  You first end up in the Tethyr woods outside
           Suldanessalar.  With no more transporting to the middle of Saradush,  
	   you'll have to find another way in. Or you can go somewhere else, 
           provided you can get directions there. <br>
	   (Not compatible with Longer Road.  Yet.)</LI>

<LI> Fight the Five in Any Order:  Right now, this just adjusts the Bioware romances
	   so that if you put off saving Saradush they'll keep going. </LI>

</UL>

<br> 
Places:
<UL>
<LI> Oasis:  If Saradush hasn't yet fallen you see a more peaceful side to
	   the oasis.  <br>
	   (Compatible with Tatics and SimDing0's Questpack)  </LI>

<LI> Saradush:  Now contains a variety of Bhaalspawn.  </LI>

<LI> Saradush Sewers:  Changes around the creatures in the sewers from Yaga Shura's minions to
	   more normal underground baddies.  You'll also get a deeper understanding of why there are so
           many shades around. </LI>
<LI> Fire Temple:  Moved around the most valuable treasures so that they are more heavily guarded in 
	   the inner part of the temple.  And there are reports that Chinchilla can talk. </LI>

</UL>
<br> <br>
Quests:
<UL>	
<LI> Cleansing the Temple:  A priestess of Kelemvor is looking to cleanse the
	   ruined Temple of Bhaal </LI>

<LI> The Witch of the Wealdath:  A capricious witch now lives in the Tethyr woods. </LI>
</UL>
<br> <br>
INSTALLATION:  
	Just like most old school WeiDU stuff: Copy the executable and the folder to your ToB directory.  Double click on the executable.  A prettier installation method is in the works.
